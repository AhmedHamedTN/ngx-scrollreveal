In particular for ScrollReveal JS, run:\nnpm install --save scrollreveal\nAngular-CLI\n\nNote: If you are using angular-cli to build your app, make sure that scrollreveal is properly listed as a global library, by editing your angular.json as such:\n\n      \"scripts\": [\n        \"../node_modules/scrollreveal/dist/scrollreveal.js\"\n      ],SystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for ngx-scrollreveal:\n\nmap: {\n  'ngx-scrollreveal': 'node_modules/ngx-scrollreveal/bundles/ngx-scrollreveal.min.js',\n}In your systemjs config file, meta needs to tell the System loader how to load scrollreveal:\n    meta: {\n    './node_modules/scrollreveal/dist/scrollreveal.min.js': {\n            format: 'amd'\n        }\n    }In your index.html file, add script tag to load  scrollreveal globally:\n    \n    \n    \n    \nNow install ngx-scrollreveal via:\nnpm install --save ngx-scrollrevealOnce installed you need to import the main module:\nimport {NgsRevealModule} from 'ngx-scrollreveal';import {NgsRevealModule} from 'ngx-scrollreveal';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [NgsRevealModule],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Usage\nThe library is composed of two main directives: ngsReveal and ngsRevealSet.\nngsReveal Directive\n\nUse this directive to reveal/hide a single DOM element upon scroll.\nBasic Usage\n    ..With Custom Options\nYou can also pass in a custom configuration object to the directive.\n    ..This will override the default configuration used when revealing this particular element.\nWhen no configuration is passed in, the directive uses the default configuration defined at component or at application level.\nConfiguration options are the same as ScrollReveal JS configuration object.\nngsRevealSet Directive\n\nUse this directive to reveal/hide a set of DOM elements upon scroll.\n[ngsSelector] attribute is required, and defines which child items must be revealed/hidden on scroll.\n\nNote: The value is a list of CSS selectors (comma-separated).\n\nBasic Usage\n    \n        Item 1\n        Item 2\n        Item 3\n        Item 4\n        Item 5 (will not be animated)\n    With Custom Options\n    \n        Item 1\n        Item 2\n        Item 3\n        Item 4\n        Item 5 (will not be animated)\n    Configuration options are the same as ScrollReveal JS configuration object. \nSequentially animated items\nChild items inside the parent set can be sequentially animated, by adding the [ngsRevealInterval] attribute.\n\nNote: The interval is the time until the next element in the sequence begins its reveal, which is separate from the time until the elementâ€™s animation completes. In this example, the sequence interval is 50 milliseconds.\n\n    \n        Item 1\n        Item 2\n        Item 3\n        Item 4\n        Item 5 (will not be animated)\n    Global Configuration\n\nYou can inject the config service, typically in your root component, and customize the values of its properties in order to provide default values for all the ng-reveal directives used in the application.\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\nimport {NgsRevealConfig} from 'ngx-scrollreveal';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],\n  providers: [NgsRevealConfig] // add NgsRevealConfig to the component providers\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(config: NgsRevealConfig) {\n    // customize default values of ngx-scrollreveal directives used by this component tree\n    config.duration = 5000;\n    config.easing = 'cubic-bezier(0.645, 0.045, 0.355, 1)';\n\n    //other options here\n  }\n}Subscribing to ScrollReveal events\n\nYou can now subscribe to some events triggered by ScrollReveal before/after an element is revealed/reset.\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { NgsRevealService } from 'ngx-scrollreveal';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']\n})\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy{\n  constructor(private revealService: NgsRevealService) {\n  }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    // subscribe to ScrollReveal observables to react to main events\n    this.beforeRevealSubscription = this.revealService.beforeReveal$.subscribe(\n      (el: HTMLElement) => {\n        console.log(`beforeReveal of '.${el.className}'`);\n      });\n\n    this.afterRevealSubscription = this.revealService.afterReveal$.subscribe(\n      (el: HTMLElement) => {\n        console.log(`afterReveal of '.${el.className}'`);\n    });\n\n    this.beforeResetSubscription = this.revealService.beforeReset$.subscribe(\n      (el: HTMLElement) => {\n        console.log(`beforeReset of '.${el.className}'`);\n    });\n\n    this.afterResetSubscription = this.revealService.afterReset$.subscribe(\n      (el: HTMLElement) => {\n        console.log(`afterReset of '.${el.className}'`);\n    });\n  }\n\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    // unsubscribe to ScrollReveal observables to prevent memory leaks\n    this.beforeRevealSubscription.unsubscribe();\n    this.afterRevealSubscription.unsubscribe();\n    this.beforeResetSubscription.unsubscribe();\n    this.afterResetSubscription.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}Credits\nngx-scrollreveal is built upon ScrollReveal JS by Julian Lloyd.
